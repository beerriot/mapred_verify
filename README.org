* mapred_verify
** Overview
   =mapred_verify= is a collection of unit tests for Riak's MapReduce
   system

** Quick Start

*** Prerequisites

    The mapred_verify tests use Riak's native Erlang interface, and
    the paths to the beams implementing that interface are described
    in terms of the Riak source tree.  So, you will need a copy of
    Riak checked out and built locally in order to use mapred_verify.

    You will also need Erlang OTP R13B04 or later installed.

*** Building

    Before using mapred_verify, you'll need to compile it.  Simple
    type =make= at the commandline.  The compilation should produce an
    executable script named =mapred_verify=.

*** Usage

    To use mapred_verify, run the script with two command line
    parameters: =-s= specifying the Erlang node name of the Riak node
    to connect to, and =-c= specifying the base directory of your Riak
    source tree:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ RIAK_NODE=riak@127.0.0.1
$ RIAK_SRC=/Users/foobar/riak
$ ./mapred_verify -s $RIAK_NODE -c $RIAK_SRC
#+END_SRC

    If running =mapred_verify= as above, with no other commandline
    arguments, runs without error, then you have built everything and
    specified arguments correctly.  If you see errors printed, please
    consult the [[Troubleshooting]] section.

    The mapred_verify script has two phases: populate (=-p=) and run
    (=-j=).  The first time you run mapred_verify, you must populate
    the dataset on which the tests will run by specifying =-p true= on
    the command line:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./mapred_verify -s $RIAK_NODE -c $RIAK_SRC -p true
Clearing old data from <<"mr_validate">>
Populating new data to <<"mr_validate">>
#+END_SRC

    A successful population run should produce output similar to that
    given above: two messages about clearing and populating data,
    including the bucket name being used.

    Once the sample dataset has been loaded, you may run the tests by
    specifying =-j true=:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./mapred_verify -s $RIAK_NODE -c $RIAK_SRC -j true

#+END_SRC

    You do not need to repopulate the dataset between tests, unless
    you delete your Riak data.

    When all tests pass, output should look similar to the capture
    above.  Each test case is run in four different ways:

    * specifying a specific list of bucket/key pairs ("discrete entries")
    * processing an entire bucket ("full bucket")
    * using keyfilters ("filtered bucket")
    * specifying a non-existent bucket/key pair ("missing object")

    Passing tests should print "OK" and an execution time (in
    milliseconds), while failing tests will print "FAIL".

** Options

   The mapred_verify script accepts three options, in addition to
   those described in the [[Quick Start]].

   The first option is =-k=, the "key count".  In the populate phase,
   this option specifies the number of objects to create.  In the
   test-running phase, this option specifies the size of the available
   input set.  It is generally a good idea to specify the same =-k=
   for your populate and test-run phases -- the full-bucket and
   filtered-bucket tests will fail validation if you do otherwise.
   This option should be specified as an integer, and it defaults to
   1000.

   The next option is =-b=, the "object size".  This option is only
   used in the populate phase.  It specifies how large the value of
   each object should be.  It is specified as an integer number of
   bytes or kilobytes, with the suffix, either =b= or =k=, determining
   which unit to use (e.g. "100b" means 100 bytes, with "48k" means 48
   kilobytes).

   The final option is =-f=, the "test filename".  This option allows
   you to specify which file defines the tests to run.  The test
   definition file is an Erlang-format file, ready for use with
   =file:consult/1=.  Each entry should be of the form
   ={Name::string(), {MapReduceQuery::list(), VerificationFunction::atom()}}.=.
   This option is specified as a path, and defaults to "priv/tests.def".

** Troubleshooting

*** ERROR: Path for ... not found or doesn't point to a directory

    mapred_verify was unable to find the compiled Erlang files that
    implement Riak's native interface.  Check the path you provided in
    the =-c= command line parameter.  The directory you provided
    should include =deps/riak_core/ebin=, =deps/riak_kv/ebin=, and
    =deps/luke/ebin=, each containing many =*.beam= files.

*** escript: exception error: ... {could_not_reach_node,'...'}

    mapred_verify was unable to connect to your Riak node.  Check the
    node name you provided in the =-s= command line parameter.  Your
    Riak node should be running, and using that name.

    mapred_verify also assumes that your node is using the cookie
    '=riak='.  If that is incorrect, please edit
    =src/mapred_verify.erl= (search for the line with
    =erlang:set_cookie=) and recompile, or change the cookie for your
    Riak node.
